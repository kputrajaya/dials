# Dials

Track health and other parameters in tabletop games without physical dials.

## Example

```
?state=[{"name":"Players","items":[{"name":"P1","metrics":[{"value":50}]},{"name":"P2","metrics":[{"value":50}]}]}]
```

This query parameter in JSON is used to set the tracker to use 1 category ("Players"), with 2 items ("P1" and "P2"),
each having 1 metric with initial value of 50.
